<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Richard Nyarko, original from a small country in the West side of Africa called Ghana. Made my way to 
  the United States through an athletic/academic scholarship. 
  My love for computer specifically web designing has gradually grown over the years and has prompted me into continuos 
  curiousity.</p>

<p>I want my creativity to show on all websites I create and also be user friendly for all individuals.</p>
