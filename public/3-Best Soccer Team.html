<h1>TOP ALL TIME CLUB SOCCER TEAM ACCORDING TO RICHARD</h1>
 <H2>Top 3 Best team of all time</H2>

<hr />
 
 <h3>FC Barcelona with Messi, Xavi, and Inieta</h3>
 <p>This team is on top of my list because of their creativity, passing, and thier ability to entertain the fans. That is just the
    offensive side of the ball. Defensively, this team was a joy to watch with their ability to quiekly win the ball back due to 
    their quick pressure. Opponents dreaded playing against this team.</p>
<h3>Second on my list is Real Madrid with Zidane, Ronaldo, and Beckham on the team</h3>
<p>This team was just hard to beat because of the emmense talent they had on both side of the ball. It was awesome to watch
    on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Third on my list is the 3 Peat Manchester United team</h3>
<p>Another amazing team with the likes of Scholes, Giggs, and Beckham. Again too much talent made it very hard
    for opponents to beat. Their aggresiveness in the middle of the park was something special to watch.</p>
